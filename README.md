A small project done over the weekend inspired by [sshp](https://github.com/bahamas10/sshp). 

`sshp` let's you execute a command over ssh on multiple machines.

_Synopsis:_ _In [Dave's video](https://youtu.be/m_Gr0510IHc), he discusses the main features of his C program, `sshp`. I found the idea intriguing and decided to challenge myself by implementing the core features from scratch using Golang._
